# summaryTool-task

A tool to display the count of featured articles where the user is among the top 10 editors.

Count of FA for editors is maintained and stored in a file. When the user enters the username, we search the userid in the file and display the corresponding result. If the userid doesn't exists, then count is shown as zero.

Check out the tool [here](https://tools.wmflabs.org/outreachy-sagorika1996/).
